## My process and what I learned

I created an XD File before coding to create a prototype of the design. I also drew the containers for each element on the page to provide a visualization of how everything is structured before I code.

I practiced how to use CSS Grid and positioning elements with start, center and end. I also practiced animations.


### Built with

- HTML and CSS
- Some BEM CSS class naming convention
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use these lines of code:

```html

```
```css

```


### Continued development and resources

In the future, I want to be able to work faster and create nav bars with fluidly using flexbow. 

- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me with CSS Grid.
- [MDN Web Docs: Box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me with styling box shadows.
- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with CSS Flexbox positioning. 
- [The 2020 Frontend Developer Crash Course for Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA0XpGhiz5w&list=WL&index=1&t=7130s) - this helped get the idea of adding an animation. I think its a nice detail that adds professionalism.

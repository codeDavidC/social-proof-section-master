## My process and what I learned

I created an XD File before coding to create a prototype of the design.

I practiced how to use CSS Grid and positioning elements with start, center and end. I also practiced animations.


### Built with

- HTML and CSS
- Some BEM CSS class naming convention
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use these lines of code:

```html

```
```css

```


### Continued development and resources

I want to have a faster workflow.

- [W3 Schools: Multiple Background Images](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This helped me with adding multiple images in the background and positioning them - even the shorthand background.
